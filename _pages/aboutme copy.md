title: About me
---

Hello, my name is Arek Kuleta, and welcome to Arek’s Dev Diary! I’m a professional Automotive/IoT embedded software engineer with a strong background in Embedded C and a growing interest in Python. I’m passionate about electronics, software architecture, and have found my niche in the world of embedded systems, IoT, and home automation. In my spare time, I manage my own Home Assistant instance and ZoneMinder site.

When I’m not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me enjoying non-technical pursuits like geocaching, hiking, or attending to the whims of my two feline friends. The idea of creating this blog was inspired by the power of AI language models like ChatGPT, which can speed up work processes and make large-scale projects manageable for individuals.

Arek’s Dev Diary is my platform for sharing my progress, challenges, and lessons learned throughout the development process. My goal is to build a tight-knit community where ideas, experiences, and insights can be exchanged. By engaging in discussions, providing peer reviews, and learning from one another, I hope to create a thriving space for collaborative growth.

Stay tuned for upcoming blog posts where I’ll share my journey, with the help of ChatGPT to generate content while ensuring personal review and authenticity. This approach allows me to strike a balance between coding and maintaining the blog, while still providing valuable and relevant information to the community.
