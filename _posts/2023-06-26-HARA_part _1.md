# HA Safety component - HARA part 1

In the previous installment of this blog series, I introduced you to the safety-focused journey we're embarking upon: the creation of a comprehensive safety system for home automation, inspired by *ISO 26262*. In today's post, we're moving forward by exploring the first crucial step in our roadmap: **Hazard analysis and risk assessment.**

## Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment - Why Does It Matter?
Safety is the foundation upon which we build our automated homes. To ensure that this foundation is robust, we need to understand the potential hazards that might compromise the safety of the home automation system and, consequently, the occupants.

This process is known as **Hazard Identification**. It involves a thorough examination of the system, components, and external factors to draw a comprehensive understanding of risks. From assessing security vulnerabilities and safety concerns to scrutinizing environmental factors and potential system malfunctions, no stone is left unturned.

Upon identification, these hazards then feed into the next critical stage - Hazard Assessment and Risk Classification. This phase quantifies the identified hazards based on their *severity*, *exposure*, and *controllability*. It calculates risk scores to determine the level of threat posed by each hazard, thereby guiding the development of safety measures and risk mitigation strategies.

## Hazard Identification - Select Examples
For a more detailed understanding, let's consider three distinct examples from the range of identified hazards:

**Unauthorized Access:** This is a risk when doors or windows are left unlocked, or a security system is left disarmed. In the context of a home automation system, this risk can be significantly reduced. A smart home system could provide immediate alerts if an entry point is compromised, or even automatically lock doors and windows when you leave the house.

**System Failure:** This is a potential risk in any automated system. A failure in the home automation system itself could lead to various problems, such as lights not working, doors not unlocking, and more. Here, it's important to have a reliable recovery strategy in place. Regular system health checks, redundancy measures, and quick troubleshooting features can help to prevent and swiftly respond to such issues.

**Unsafe Cold/Heat Exposure:** This hazard comes into play when room temperatures fall below or rise above safe levels for the occupants. For example, the bathroom temperature should be at least 22Â°C during a child's bath. A well-configured home automation system can continually monitor and control the temperature, ensuring a comfortable and safe environment.

For more in-depth knowledge, consider exploring the comprehensive hazard identification section in the linked document on our [repository](github.com/Arkaqius/SafetyComponent).

## Hazard Assessment and Risk Classification - Breaking It Down
Once we've identified the potential hazards, we need to assess them based on their severity, exposure, and controllability.

- **Severity** refers to the potential harm a hazard can cause. High severity hazards, like fires or gas leaks, can cause serious harm, such as injury or significant property damage. Medium severity hazards, such as unauthorized access, can lead to potential costs if not addressed promptly. Low severity hazards, like poor air quality, can cause discomfort and could potentially impact health if the exposure is sustained or repeated.

- **Exposure** refers to the likelihood of a hazard occurring. High exposure hazards are part of the routine or daily operation and therefore have a higher likelihood of happening, while medium exposure hazards are possible under certain circumstances. Low exposure hazards are very unlikely to occur under normal circumstances.

- **Controllability** refers to how much a user can prevent or mitigate a hazard. High controllability hazards can be easily managed by the user, while medium controllability hazards might require more effort or specialized knowledge. Low controllability hazards are often beyond the control of the residents.

## Hazards assestment:
Each hazard's risk score is calculated based on three key factors: Severity, Exposure, and Controllability, with different weightings for 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' levels.

The risk score directs us to the hazard's risk level, dictating the necessary safety measures and risk mitigation strategies. For precise numerical calculations and threshold values, refer to the relevant section in our repository document.
