Welcome to the project roadmap for VoiceHAC! In this blog, I'll be documenting my journey as I work on an ambitious project that involves integrating Mycroft, an open-source voice assistant, with Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities using the nltk library, as well as harnessing the power of GPT-2 and GPT-4 models from PyTorch and OpenAI, respectively. The ultimate goal is to create an intelligent and context-aware voice assistant that can interact with my Home Assistant setup and provide seamless control over my smart home devices.

The roadmap below outlines the various steps and milestones involved in this project. As I make progress, I'll be sharing updates, challenges, and lessons learned through blog posts. Stay tuned to follow along and learn from my experiences as I embark on this exciting journey!

## Mycroft:  

- [x] Implement a general fallback skill in Mycroft to process all requests. Customize it further as needed.  
- [ ] Develop a Home Assistant API helper with functions for getting/setting entities, running services, and controlling Home Assistant itself.  
    *Will use existing library*  

## NLP (using nltk library):  

- [x] Install the nltk library and download necessary data sets.  
- [x] Implement Intent Recognition:  
    - [x] Create a training dataset with sample sentences and corresponding intents.  
    - [x] Train a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, or SVM) using the dataset.  
    - [x] Write a function to predict intents using the trained classifier.  
    - [x] Implement Entity Extraction:  
        - [x] Tokenize sentences.  
        - [x] Perform part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition using nltk functions.  
        - [x] Write a function to extract relevant entities from user queries.  

## Context Manager:  

- [ ] Design a data structure to store conversation history.  
- [ ] Implement functions for adding new interactions and retrieving context information.  
- [ ] Implement logic for handling follow-up questions and providing context-aware responses.  

## PyTorch GPT-2 Model:  

- [ ] Install the required PyTorch library.  
- [ ] Obtain a pre-trained GPT-2 model or train your own from scratch using a dataset.  
- [ ] Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on Home Assistant-specific tasks using a custom dataset.  
- [ ] Implement functions for processing queries, generating responses or API calls, and interacting with the Context Manager.  

## OpenAI GPT-4 Model:  

- [ ] Sign up for an OpenAI API key.  
- [ ] Install the required OpenAI library.  
- [ ] Implement an OpenAI API wrapper in Python, including functions for:  
- [ ] Sending user queries to the GPT-4 model.  
- [ ] Receiving generated responses.  
- [ ] Interacting with the Context Manager to maintain conversation context.  
- [ ] Integration:

## Connect Mycroft to the NLP component.
- [ ] Integrate the NLP component with the Context Manager.  
- [ ] Implement logic to route queries to the appropriate GPT model based on context and intent.  
- [ ] Integrate the Home Assistant API helper with the NLP component and GPT models to perform requested actions.  
- [ ] Testing and Debugging:  

## Test the system with various user queries and scenarios.  
- [ ] Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.  
- [ ] Optimize the system's performance based on test results.
