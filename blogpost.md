## Introduction
I'm *Arek Kuleta*, a professional Automotive/IoT software engineer and a user of Home Assistant. While we all share a passion for our setups, I feel that safety often takes a back seat. That's why I decided to integrate some of the **safety methods** from my professional experience into our home automation systems.

--- 
I'm actively working on incorporating safety practices inspired by automotive standards such as  **ASPICE**, **ISO 26262**, **EGAS**, and **ISO 21434** into our Home Assistant setups. I am not following every point from them, just trying to tailor it to my needs and available resources.
My aim is to create a secure and reliable environment that safeguards our privacy and ensures the integrity of our connected devices. I'm aware of Home Assistant Supervisor and I'm planning to integrate it into my system. 

--- 
It's important to note that these standards were primarily designed for C applications running on ASIL-rated operating systems and ASIL-rated microcontrollers. Adapting them to the Docker and Python environment might be challenging, if not impossible. To assist me in this project, I rely on OpenAI's ChatGPT. This powerful language model not only aids in generating content but also ensures personal review and authenticity. It allows me to focus more on the technical aspects while providing reliable assistance.

## Current status
My journey has already begun with a Hazard Analysis Risk Analysis (**HARA**), which identifies potential risks involved in home automation.
Based on this analysis, I've outlined the system requirements and architecture for a safer Home Assistant setup. To avoid overloading this post, I've kept post short. You'll find short descriptions and examples on my [blog](https://arkaqius.github.io/), while the full documentation is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Arkaqius/SafetyComponent/tree/feature/SafetyConcept). 


## Things to do
We still have a long way to go, with several key areas to focus on:

*Calibration:* Customizing our safety solution to fit specific home automation systems and individual setups.  
*Interface Requirements:* Addressing pending system interfaces to ensure seamless integration.  
*Hardware Requirements:* Determining necessary sensors and selecting the appropriate platform, initially utilizing the same host as Home Assistant for our safety setup.  
*Software Requirements:* Defining functional and non-functional requirements to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of our safety system.  
*Software Architecture:* Designing a robust blueprint for our safety system, incorporating the EGAS standard to reinforce safety aspects.

But before I proceed, I will shift my attention to the implementation phase to create a **proof of concept**. I hope that **I will show it in the next update.**
